AI-Powered Personal Health Assistant

Overview:
This project is an AI-powered health assistant designed to run entirely locally for privacy and performance. It predicts possible diseases based on user symptoms and offers clear explanations, safe medication suggestions, and daily health guidance. It also generates personalized 7-day workout and diet plans using Ollama’s local LLMs, integrates with Google Calendar, and recommends nearby pharmacies—all without sending data to the cloud.
